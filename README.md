GraphAlchemy
============

GraphAlchemy - No more magic.

GraphAlchemy is a Object-Graph Mapper (OGM) for Python. It aims to be compatible
with all Blueprints-enabled graph implementations, as well as Neo4J.

Disclaimer : this module is under active development. It's dirty, full of bugs,
only partially tested, and its APIs will change a lot in the incoming months. Use
at your own risk. Contributions welcome.
